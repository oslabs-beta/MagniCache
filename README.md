## What is MagniCache?

MagniCache is a lightweight and performant GraphQL caching solution. Packaged and shipped as two separate npm packages, MagniCache can be implemented seamlessly into projects as an Express middleware for server-side caching of queries and mutations, or as a localStorage manipulation device for client-side caching.

## Why use MagniCache?

MagniCache is unique in its exceptional efficiency. MagniCache's caching algorithm methodically parses GraphQL queries and divides them into atomic components, allowing for systematic and fully coherent caching of queries and improvements in performance. Unlike other GraphQL caching layers, subsequent GraphQL queries do not have to be exact duplicates of cached queries in order to benefit from cached response speeds. In addition, MagniCache was developed with compactness as the priority, so you can rest assured that implementing MagniCache into your projects will add zero unnecessary bulk.
